# odin-landing-page

This repo contains all the files that were necessary in the creation of the example landing page originally assigned to me by The Odin Project (TOP) - Foundations course. After already replicating the provided image of TOP's landing page, I decided to "make it my own" by designing it in the format of a freelance art commissioning website. 

In addition, all images used in this project were referenced from the free stock image hosting site, pexels.com.
